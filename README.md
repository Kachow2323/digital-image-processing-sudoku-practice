# Feature Detection Practice: Image Derivatives and Pixel Gradients
Explore how image derivatives measure pixel intensity changes to identify features using OpenCV. Covers both first-order (Sobel) and second-order (Laplacian) derivative edge detection methods.
## Highlights
- Sobel Operator - Calculate maximum magnitude of the image gradient in the X and Y directions to find horizontal and vertical edges.
- Laplacian Operator - Finds zero_crossing points to detect edges.
